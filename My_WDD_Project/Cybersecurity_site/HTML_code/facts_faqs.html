                    Hi! My name is Dallin Scott. I am currently studying Computer Information Technology (CIT) at Brigham Young University Idaho, emphasizing in and working toward becoming a Cybersecurity Analyst (Hacker). I am proud of my achievements and well-rounded skills. My talents range from technological savvy to musicality to athletic abilities and relational/communication skills. I have worked hard in school, work, and life to become the best version of myself. By always seeking to be my best, I encourage others to live the same way. That is how I operate my company, by encouraging everyone to be their best self. The elite individuals I work with, who possess the crucial technological knowledge needed in Cybersecurity services support the growing need for cyber safety in a world of increasing technological terrorism and computer threats. Let us help you keep your computers, phones, tablets, and technological devices safe, personally, for your family, and for your business!

                    The social and economic shock presented by the coronavirus pandemic is reshaping perceptions of organizations and individuals about occupations and the work. This has created micro and macro shifts, as well as work-from-home strategies.
                    When 2020 began, most managers may have supervised just a few remote workers. Because of the current global health crisis, most companies have instructed their workers to handle their tasks from the comfort of their homes.
                    This new trend has both benefits and downsides. For instance, working from home allows more flexibility and reduces travel time for most employees. On the flip side, it exposes them to possible cyber-attacks, an issue that could affect their personal data and that of the organizations they work for. Here are online safety tips for remote workers.<br><br>

                    <li class="bulleted">
                        <u><!--1. -->Keep your computers’ OS up to date</u><br>
                        <p class = 'bulleted'>Generally, updating your desktops, phones, laptops, and other devices is one of the most reliable steps to improve online security when working from home. Sometimes, these OS updates are time-consuming. But that doesn’t mean you should always ignore them.
                        Consider using the update wait time to stretch your legs and probably venture outside for a quick walk. You can also update your devices while handling home chores or out with your family.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="bulleted">
                        <u><!--2. -->Encrypt your network using a virtual private network (VPN)</u><br>
                        <p class = 'bulleted'>Even when you’re using your devices at home, you may be at risk of an unanticipated data breach. If you are homes wireless connection isn’t encrypted, it is vulnerable to sniffers and various computer programs used to decode information and make it readable to third parties. The bad guys tend to use sniffers to spy, hijack devices, and steal data.
                        A reliable VPN allows users to safely communicate over any wireless connection by establishing encrypted and highly secure connections. It successfully routes information from a device through service in various locations and scrambles it to make it inaccessible by third parties.</p>

                        <p class = 'bulleted'>With the significant transition of employees moving their work away from conventional offices, there are a good chance more emails about how your bank, employer, and various apps that are using will be updating or changing in some way. Hackers could use this chance to attempt to phish for your employer’s passwords and other forms of data.
                        Be careful when opening any email that you receive or any prompts to install anything onto your computer. After all, you don’t want to install ransomware or malware onto your device.</p>

                        <p class = 'bulleted'>It is recommended to enable two-factor authentication whenever possible on all your work accounts. This means you will need an additional one-time passcode to access the account. From your email accounts and social media task management software to various project management platforms, you should at least be using two-factor authentication to ensure your accounts are secure.
                        Two-factor authentication minimizes the risk of brute-force hacking that could grant someone access to your online accounts and still your personal or organization’s data.</p>
